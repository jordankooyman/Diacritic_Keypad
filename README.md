# Diacritic_Keypad
An Arduino-based custom keyboard for typing diacritic letters with ease, particularly on Windows, but with support for many Linux distros as well.

Written for Arduino Pro Micro/Arduino Leonardo boards
Intended for use with 17 buttons and a switch, all connected to the arduino via chained shift registers
Uses 1 RGB LED (common negative) for status indication at runtime

All CAD files and wiring diagrams are included.

Due to the variability of wiring and desired character outputs, the code included is incomplete and all character combinations must be written in manually.
If you have any questions regarding how to modify the code or wire things together, feel free to reach out to me at jordankooyman@gmail.com
